## 2026-10-12 — Codex — M1 orientation and setup checks
Done:
- Pulled the latest repo and read AGENTS, roadmap, decisions, M1 brief, game design, art bible and UI spec. No gameplay or production assets built; implementation awaits the user's go.
- Lune and Studio `ServerStorage.Tests.RunAll` both passed: 28 passed, 0 failed. The required Shared, Server and Tests folders exist in the Glass Clash place (129420351303019).
- Loaded the Blender helper with GLASSCLASH_REPO set to this checkout. Blender 5.2.2 LTS self_check passed: repo found, assets writable, 576-triangle temporary body, 8 test shards.
- Found the existing toolchain in `%USERPROFILE%\.rokit\bin` and added it to the test shell's PATH. Started Rojo serving this repo at localhost:34872.
Next:
- Reconnect the Studio Rojo plugin, then await go. Follow M1 in order: Blender art, Studio import, server battle service, client animation/HUD/cracks/shatter. Play-test, inspect Output, test, commit and push after each step.
Problems / questions for the user:
- Studio Output reports Rojo disconnected. The server is now listening; click Connect in the Rojo plugin before code edits. The roadmap setup checkbox stays unticked until the live connection is confirmed.
- The normal shell PATH does not include the existing Rokit bin folder; commands work when it is added for the session.

## 2026-10-12 — Claude — M0 Setup
Done:
- Wrote GAME_DESIGN.md, RESOURCES.md, ART_BIBLE.md, MAP_PLAN.md, UI_SPEC.md and the rest of `docs/`.
- Built UI mockups in Figma (Glassies screen, Battle screen, style kit).
- Set up the repo: AGENTS.md, Rojo project, Rokit toolchain, StyLua config, CI.
- Wrote the pure game logic and content config in `src/shared`, the UI `Theme` tokens, tests and the balance simulator.
- Wrote the Blender helper script and tested it in Blender 5.2 (bpy): `self_check()`, `build_all_starters()` and `export_clash_stand()` all work and produce FBX, .blend and icons.
- Balance: tuned with the simulator. Even fights ~5 clashes, type advantage ~80-85%, Zone 1 trainers 74-100% for the player, Rusty ~45-49% for every starter (bosses mirror your type), level 15 after ~24 wins.
Next:
- M1 feel prototype (see ROADMAP). Start with docs/prompts/01_feel_prototype.md.
Problems / questions for the user:
- Final game name and collectible name are still placeholders.
